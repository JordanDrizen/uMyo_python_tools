## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style Standards
```python
"""
Follow Google Python Style Guide with project-specific adaptations:
- Line length: 160 characters (configured in setup.cfg)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Prefer explicit imports over wildcard imports
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect the domain (EMG, quaternion, etc.)
"""

# Example: Well-documented function
def calculate_emg_rms(signal_data: List[int], window_size: int = 50) -> float:
    """Calculate root mean square (RMS) of EMG signal.
    
    Args:
        signal_data: List of EMG signal samples (16-bit signed integers)
        window_size: Number of samples for RMS calculation window
        
    Returns:
        RMS value of the signal over the specified window
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If window_size is larger than signal_data length
        
    Example:
        >>> emg_samples = [100, -150, 200, -80, 120]
        >>> rms_value = calculate_emg_rms(emg_samples, window_size=5)
        >>> print(f"RMS: {rms_value:.2f}")
        RMS: 138.74
    """
    if len(signal_data) < window_size:
        raise ValueError(f"Window size {window_size} exceeds data length {len(signal_data)}")
    
    # Use recent window for RMS calculation
    recent_samples = signal_data[-window_size:]
    squared_sum = sum(sample ** 2 for sample in recent_samples)
    return math.sqrt(squared_sum / window_size)
```

### Performance Optimization Guidelines
```python
"""
Real-time EMG processing requires careful performance optimization:
"""

# ‚úÖ Good: Use efficient data structures
from collections import deque
signal_buffer = deque(maxlen=1000)  # Automatic size limiting

# ‚ùå Avoid: Inefficient list operations
signal_list = []
if len(signal_list) > 1000:
    signal_list = signal_list[-1000:]  # Expensive slice operation

# ‚úÖ Good: Vectorized operations with numpy
import numpy as np
def efficient_filtering(data):
    return np.convolve(data, np.ones(5)/5, mode='valid')  # Moving average

# ‚ùå Avoid: Python loops for numerical computation
def slow_filtering(data):
    filtered = []
    for i in range(4, len(data)):
        avg = sum(data[i-4:i+1]) / 5
        filtered.append(avg)
    return filtered
```
